# **"Who are you?"**
Well, nothing special, just an eighteen year old person interested in computers and art. \
Name's **Debojit**, `Coder Debojit` to be exact. Call me Debojit if you wanna. \
I'm not a professional in any way whatsoever, I do things to have fun and cause its interesting.
> Yes I leaked my irl name on the internet, it is fine.

# **"Where are you from? Where do you belong?"**
Guess it.
> Please don't dox me, thanks >~<

# **"What are you doing currently? What are you learning?"**
I'm learning and playing around with a few languages, see pinned repositories for an idea of what I'm upto. 

The languages currently are: 
- Python
- JS
- PHP

Maybe I'll play with a bit of PHP

I wanna write software to entertain myself and help people. \
Tho I don't think I achived the latter goal till now.

> Fun stuff aside, I just gave entrance examination for college, kinda scared how the results would be.

# **"Eww, I see a weeb profile."**
Can't help it, it's the best way to hide my face on this account
> Why do people hate weebs .-.

# **"Cool, what more interests you?"**

My interests are quite, weird. They're scattered all over the place. \
I've been fascinated by music and have studied it since the age of 6, I've performed on stage and on air but yeah now I've been away from that. I specialize in key instruments. \
Another thing that interests me is Media Production, aka, working with audio, video and broadcasting media.

> I just like art in general. also feeds the reason of me being obsessed with Japanese drawings (⋟ ﹏ ⋞)


# **"I wanna talk to you, how can I reach you?"**
There ya go, but yea I might be slow to respond. ＼(￣O￣) \
Just don't be a creep, thanks ● ﹏ ●

> Don't ask for feet pic, thank you .( ̵˃﹏˂̵ )
